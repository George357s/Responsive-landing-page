# Responsive-landing-page
A responsive product landing page for a black and white tumbler cup.
This page was made in mobile first css using media queries.
Original Dribbble Design By Quan: https://dribbble.com/shots/6442400-The-Blvck-Tumbler.
Some of the things I learned from this exercise is how to-
- Create a responsive full screen product page
- Make complex & creative layouts with CSS grid & Flexbox
- Use CSS variables to quickly switch colors across the whole website
- Create a dark to light theme switch using pure Javascript code
- Make a mobile first website from scratch
- Toggle images and text elements with Javascript
- Build amazing decorations and CSS effects 
- Use colors wisely across the webpage
